A duplicate license can be requested if the original is lost, stolen, damaged, or unreadable. For card-model licenses, a new license is issued rather than a duplicate. Residents with a foreign driver's license cannot renew or request a duplicate but must apply for a Belgian driver's license. Belgians residing outside the EEA and registered at a Belgian embassy can renew their driver's license in the last Belgian municipality where they were registered."

Certain combinations are prohibited to avoid confusion with official plates or for ethical reasons. The cost for reserving a personalized plate is €1,000, plus an additional €30 for production and delivery by bpost.

You will receive your registration certificate and license plate the next working day. Alternatively, you can send the form directly to the DIV, and upon processing, you will receive your registration certificate. To deregister a vehicle, return the license plate as soon as possible to stop paying road taxes."
